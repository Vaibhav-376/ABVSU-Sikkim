        The Women Sexual Harassment Committee also provides a platform for

        with their experiences. The committee is dedicated to handling each case
        with sensitivity and confidentiality, ensuring that the privacy of all
        parties involved is respected.

        Furthermore, the committee collaborates with various university
        departments to develop and implement policies aimed at preventing sexual
        harassment. This includes formulating guidelines for behavior, enhancing
        campus safety measures, and establishing protocols for handling
        complaints effectively. By working closely with the administration, the
        committee strives to create a comprehensive framework that promotes a
        culture of respect and accountability.

        In addition to addressing incidents of harassment, the committee
        actively promotes women’s empowerment and gender equality within the
        university. By organizing events, workshops, and discussions focused on
        women’s rights, self-defense, and leadership skills, the committee seeks
        to inspire female students to stand up for themselves and advocate for
        their rights. This empowerment initiative is crucial in building
        confidence among women, encouraging them to pursue their academic and
        career goals without fear or hesitation.
